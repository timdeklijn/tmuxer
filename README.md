# TMUXER

## WHAT?

A small script to open tmux session in a subfolder of `~/workspace`. It will
open two windows: one names `CODE` with an editor open and one names `TERM` with
nothing open.

## Install

First clone this repo. In a directory in your path, create a soft link (`ln -s`)
to the `tmuxer.sh` script in this repo.

## TODO

- [ ] Create a `tmux` pop-up with the fuzzy finder
